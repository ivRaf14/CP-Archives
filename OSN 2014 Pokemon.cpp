Its eyes have red irises, while the sclera and pupils are white. Bulbasaur has a pair of small, pointed teeth visible when its mouth is open. It has a bulb on its back, grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.
As mentioned in the anime, starter Pokemon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers. Having been domesticated from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokemon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. Bulbasaur has also shown itself to be an excellent caretaker, even having a special technique called the "Bulba-by." To perform this technique, Bulbasaur uses its vines to pick up a young Pokemon and soothingly rocks the young one in the air.
It is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as starter Pokemon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been observed that a Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to become Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.

It evolves from Slowpoke starting at level 37. It is one of Slowpoke's final forms, the other being Slowking. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Slowbro using an unknown Mega Stone. As Mega Slowbro, its Defense and Special Attack stats increase.
Slowbro is a bipedal, pink Pokemon with a tan, striped belly and a tan muzzle. It has large, vacant eyes, curled ears, and two pointed teeth in its upper jaw. On its hands, it has three clawed fingers, and two clawed toes on its feet. There is a Shellder attached to its tail. This Shellder has a gray, spiraled shell with darker spots. There are several spikes across the surface of Shellder, and it holds onto Slowbro with many sharp teeth. If Shellder is knocked off, Slowbro will return to its unevolved form.
Slowbro has lost the capability to feel pain due to Shellder's poison. However, it apparently becomes inspired when Shellder bites down. While it is capable of unleashing powerful psychic attacks, it is peaceful and prefers not to fight. Because it can no longer fish using its tail, it swims to catch its prey and allows Shellder to feed on its scraps. Slowbro tends to live near ponds, lakes, and seashores.
When Slowbro Mega Evolves into Mega Slowbro, it becomes engulfed by the Shellder to the point where only its head, arms and tail are visible.

>Magnemite 18
Magnemite is a dual-type Electric/Steel Pokemon, and formerly, in Generation I, a pure Electric-type Pokemon.
It evolves into Magneton starting at level 30, which evolves into Magnezone when leveled up in either Mt. Coronet, Chargestone Cave, or on Kalos Route 13.
Magnemite is a seemingly robotic life form that has a gray, spherical metal body with horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye. It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body, and the other on top of its head and looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokedex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, the anime has shown that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. It has even exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrients is electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph, indicating it has existed for at least 1,500 years.
The magnetic units on Magnemite's body create electromagnetic waves that allow it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive, but may approach Trainers with little notice. It can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Poketch. It has even been shown to be attracted to electric Pokemon producing such fields. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, it has been demonstrated that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite do not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will start retaliation with non-damaging moves.
Uses antigravity to stay suspended. Appears without warning and uses Thunder Wave and similar moves.

>Magneton 20
Magneton is a dual-type Electric/Steel Pokemon and formerly, in Generation I, a pure Electric-type Pokemon.
It evolves from Magnemite starting at level 30 and evolves into Magnezone when leveled up in either Mt. Coronet, Chargestone Cave, or on Kalos Route 13.
Magneton is the result of three Magnemite being linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when no other Magnemite are in the vicinity. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked via body on the bottom, forming a triangle. However, in some cases, commonly seen in 3D Pokemon games, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remaining in a triangular formation at rest, and being able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. The magnetic forces that holds the three Magnemite together is powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature 3.6 Ã‚Â°F in the vicinity. It can also be disruptive to electronic devices.
Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still has the need to eat. As seen in the anime, food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain, often near power plants. When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. It has been shown in the manga that it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph, indicating it has existed for at least 1,500 years.

>Doduo 16
Doduo is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokemon.
It evolves into Dodrio starting at level 31.
Doduo is a two-headed, bipedal avian Pokemon. Each head has a long sharp beak and two beady black eyes with no discernible sclera.

The males of the species have black flexible necks, whereas females have brown necks; both genders have brown coloring on their legs. It has two feet, each with four digits ending in a sharp claw.
Even when sleeping or nourishing itself with food and water, one head is always awake and alert and keeps a keen eye out for enemies. Both heads have an identical brain. However, it is believed that on occasion they may possess different sets of brains. It is also theorized that the two heads communicate with some form of telepathy to be coordinated with one another. Due to its almost non-existent wings, it cannot fly very well but has developed its legs to be very powerful runner. Reaching speeds of 60 mph, it energetically strides across the plains leaving large, 4" deep foot prints behind it. Doduo lives in wide open plains, grasslands, and savannahs.
A bird that makes up for its poor flying with its fast foot speed. Leaves giant footprints.

>Dodrio 17
Dodrio is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokemon.
It evolves from Doduo starting at level 31.
Dodrio is a large, wingless, three-headed avian Pokemon. Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black feathered, V-shaped crest. It has bristly brown feathers covering its heads and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with anisodactyl feet and sharp claws on each toe. Males have black necks, whereas females have brown necks; both genders have brown legs.
Each head has its own working brain and distinct personality, representing and expressing sorrow, anger and joy respectively. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion it may over think and analyze a situation, causing itself to be immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the heads are well known to squabble with one another. Often they will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of the heads gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. Another adaption it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. While two are asleep, one will stand guard and look out for any approaching enemies. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous, and going near it may result in a severe pecking.
Along with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains, even in arid seasons with little rainfall.
Uses its three brains to execute complex plans. While two heads sleep, one head is said to stay awake.
One of Doduo's 2 heads splits to form a unique species. It runs close to 40 MPH in prairies.
The three heads express joy, sorrow and anger as they plan strategy together. When it sleeps, one head remains awake.
It collects data and plans three times as wisely, but it may think too much and become immobilized.
If one of the heads gets to eat, the others will be satisfied, too, and they will stop squabbling.
An enemy that takes its eyes off any of the three heads--even for a second--will get pecked severely.
Watch out if Dodrio's three heads are looking in three separate directions. It's a sure sign that it is on its guard. Don't go near this Pokemon if it's being wary - it may decide to peck you.
Apparently, the heads aren't the only parts of the body that Dodrio has three of. It has three sets of hearts and lungs as well, so it is capable of running long distances without rest.

It is constantly oozing; endlessly leaking a germ-infected fluid from all parts of its body. Pieces of it often breaks off during travel, and from these pieces new Grimer will begin to grow. When combined with another Grimer, it produces new poisonous compounds.
Due to its lack of a solid form, it is capable of squeezing into any space or crevices with relative ease.

It evolves into Cloyster when exposed to a Water Stone.
Shellder is a black pearl-like Pokemon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. It has an enormously long red tongue, which it uses to burrow itself into sand and to lure and capture prey. Its body is known to be soft and tender; however, its shell is said to be harder than diamond. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar. Once ensnared by Omastar's tentacles, its hard shell stood no match to the Spiral Pokemon's deadly powerful bite, and its soft insides quickly devoured.
Shellder can develop a symbiotic relationship with Slowpoke. After attaching itself to the Dopey Pokemon's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and together evolve into Slowbro. If it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock, the two will instead evolve into Slowking. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and obtain a new stage in its life cycle.
Regardless of which form the two Pokemon evolve into, Shellder's shell transforms into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder will have a red jewel on its underside and a large horn on either side of its shell.
While in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokemon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns.
Shellder has two former signature moves. It can shoot spears of ice by using Icicle Spear, or clamp tightly to its opponents using Clamp. Despite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort.

Its shell is harder than diamond with spikes that are even harder; harsh tidal currents will affect the size and sharpness of these spikes. On its pearl-like face, it has two white eyes and a mouth. Aside from its face and head, its internal anatomy has never been seen.
It typically only opens its shell to attack an opponent. However, it is fully capable of retaliating against any enemy with its shell tightly closed. With rapid succession, it launches its spikes at the foe, keeping them repelled. Once it has shut itself in, it is impossible to open its shell from the outside. This impressive defense allows it to withstand anything from a bomb blast to even a missile strike. The same projectile system it uses to launch its spikes is also used for swimming. It swallows seawater, and then ejects it towards the rear propelling it through with siphon-jet propulsion. It lives on the sea floor, nestled among the rocks and coral.

In the wild, Krabby lives near the edge of water in both fresh and salt water. Krabby is most commonly found on beaches where it burrows in the sand to live. In times of scarce food sources, it may eat sand to regain nutrients, and will be very aggressive in defending its home.
